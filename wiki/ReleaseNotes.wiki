------------------------------------------------------------------------
= omicron v1.1 =
*Initial Revision*: 16
*Branch-out Revision*: 35
== Summary ==
	This is the first version to be released as a binary package too (windows only for now).
	The most important changes from 1.0 are the following:
		* omicron now supports a new binary event streaming protocol. The protocol is supported by `oinputserver` and `NetService` by default. The old string-based protocol is still available through `LegacyNetService` and `legacy-oinputserver`
		* we added *omicronConnector*. omicronConnector is a header-only library that allows C++ applications to easily connect to input server instances and receive events over a TCP/UDP connection.
		* a few utility methods have been added to the Config and ArgumentHelper APIs.
		* The implementation of reference counting and smart pointer support has been completed. This also allowed fixing a few memory leaks in the library.
